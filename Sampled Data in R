Working with Sampled Data in R

We rarely have complete data about something we want to know. 
For example, we often want to know who will win a political election, but we do not have the time to ask 
every potential voter who they plan to vote for. And people's attitudes change during a campaign.

However, it is possible to take get the opinion of a small number of people and make an estimate of
the possible outcomes of the election.

That small number of people is called a sample, and the estimate we make about the broader population is called an inference.

Descriptive statistics is the use of statistical techniques to describe data.

Inferential statistics is the use of statistical techniques to make inferences about a 
complete population based on a sample from that population.
